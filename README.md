room-scheduling-hackerrank-kata

timed hackerrank kata done in java.

CONTEXT

coding test done under time pressure. make a room scheduler module that takes in a start and end datetime for a meeting, and returns room numbers [1-8] for which room the meeting gets assigned to, -1 if there are no rooms that can take in said meeting, or -2 if the meeting inputs are invalid according to certain rules.

POST-MORTEM

i was aiming to solve with as minimal code / class gore as possible. lost time looking for the best data structure to hold meeting. was ultimately unable to solve within the testing time.

after de-stressing, gave myself three hours from scratch, and was able to do proper separation of concerns / classing. no other fancy-butt data structure was needed, and the flow is much more readable than my original test result.

wip - put in maven tests
